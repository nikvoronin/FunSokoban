😊 Write a minimalistic F# Sokoban game. Do not use mutable vars. The game should run in console.

🤖 (Thought for 32s)\
Here’s a single-file, purely functional (no mutable), minimalistic Sokoban for the console in F#.
Controls: arrows to move, U to undo, R to restart the level, Q to quit.

😊 Write down a rules for console to build and run the game as an fsx script

🤖 (Thought for 9s)\
Here’s the quickest way to run the Sokoban you have as a single .fsx script in the console—no build step required.

😎 Fix following error: fsokoban.fsx(49,71): error FS3373: Invalid interpolated string. Single quote or verbatim string literals may not be used in interpolated expressions in single quote or verbatim strings. Consider using an explicit 'let' binding for the interpolation expression or use a triple quote string as the outer string literal.

🤖 (Thought for 18s)\
You’re hitting FS3373 because that line uses an interpolated string with string literals inside the interpolation hole. Some F# versions disallow that (especially with verbatim/triple-quoted outers). Easiest fix: compute the status text first, then interpolate (or use sprintf).

😎 Fix the next one: fsokoban.fsx(87,23): error FS0072: Lookup on object of indeterminate type based on information prior to this program point. A type annotation may be needed prior to this program point to constrain the type of the object. This may allow the lookup to be resolved.

🤖 (Thought for 10s)\
That error comes from ambiguous types in the parser: Set.empty didn’t tell the compiler what element type the sets hold, and using + on sets also confused inference. Fix it by (1) explicitly typing the empty sets as Set<Pos> and (2) using Set.union instead of +.

😎 How to avoid the following warning: fsokoban.fsx(163,3): warning FS2304: Functions with [<EntryPoint>] are not invoked in FSI. 'main' was not invoked. Execute 'main <args>' in order to invoke 'main' with the appropriate string array of command line arguments.

🤖 Good news: that warning is harmless.

It happens because you are running the script with F# Interactive (dotnet fsi), and FSI does not automatically call [<EntryPoint>] functions — it just compiles them.

...

Would you like me to rewrite the tail of the script so it works both as an .fsx (interactive) and as a compiled console app without editing?

😊 Let's extract level data to external text file. Load the level file on the start.

🤖 (Thought for 9s)\
Great idea. Here’s a minimal, no-mutable change to load the level from an external text file at startup.
It works both as an .fsx script (FSI) and when compiled.

😊 Come up with another four test levels

🤖 Sure! Here are four small Sokoban test levels you can drop into text files.

Do you want me to bundle these four into a single “levels pack” file (with separators) so the game could eventually support selecting different rooms?

😊 Yes, bundle that

🤖 Perfect 👍 Let’s bundle those four test levels into one file. A simple convention is to separate levels with a line starting with ; (comment/metadata) or a blank line. Sokoban level packs often do that.

...

Do you want me to extend your game loop so it automatically lets the player move to the next level after solving, cycling through this pack?

😊 Yes, extend a game loop. And make level choice at start.

🤖 (Thought for 21s)\
Awesome—here’s a drop‑in extension that (1) loads a level pack with multiple rooms, (2) shows a level selection menu at start, and (3) lets you go to Next/Prev level from within the game (and auto-advance when solved). All still immutable (no mutable), console-only.

😊 Levels 2 and 3 are impossible. Fix those.

🤖 (Thought for **2m 35s**)\
You're right—those two had deadlocks. Here are fixed, solvable replacements bundled into a fresh levels.txt (Levels 1 & 4 unchanged, 2 & 3 redesigned).

😊 Suggest sources where I can get free Sokoban levels

🤖 Here are some good places where you can get free Sokoban level packs (all plain text, easy to adapt to the ASCII format your game already parses)

...

I suggest starting with Microban 1 (by David W. Skinner). It’s widely used for testing, contains 155 small puzzles, and all are solvable without nasty tricks.

Would you like me to adapt a ready-to-use Microban pack into your levels.txt format so you can drop it straight into your game?

😊 Adapt please

🤖 (Thought for 31s)\
Great news: the Microban packs are already in standard XSB (plain ASCII) format that your game understands (# . $ * @ + with blank lines between levels and optional comment lines starting with ;).
So you don’t actually need to modify the game—just point it at the Microban file.
